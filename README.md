# JBenchmarks
J language benchmarks: 
## Kernighan/Van Wyk
A set of functions that implement the Kernighan/Van Wyk benchmarks (originally made to run in C language) with a test harness function runs them using the timing and memory functions built into J.

Requires a copy of the King James Version of the Bible (or other large text) which can be found at Project Guttenburg.

__KWVbmarks.ijs__ is the J language script file that implements the benchmark\
__KWVbmarks__ function is the test harness for the collected rouines\
__usage:__ KWVbmarks ''

## Advanced Benchmarks
These were loosely taken from a scheme language set of benchmarks and use J language implemetation that is similar but not a direct transcription of the scheme routines.

__ADVbenchmarks.ijs__ is the J language script file that contains these benchmarks\
__ADVbmarks__ function is the test harness\
__usage:__ ADVbmarks ''\
